## Part 1: AI Experiment Report

### 1. Report Title

Jobi – Job Description Creator to Attract the Best Talent

---

### 2. Summary / Executive Overview

This experiment aims to automate, standardise, and enhance the process of creating job descriptions (JDs). By leveraging AI to tap into both internal and external data sources, the tool will produce more engaging, up-to-date, and consistent JDs that reflect the company’s culture, DE&I goals, and current market trends. The goal is to reduce manual drafting time, improve candidate quality, and streamline talent acquisition.

---

### 3. Objective

Develop an AI-driven bot (Jobi) that generates and refines job descriptions:

- Decrease manual effort and inconsistencies in JD creation.
- Align JDs with company culture and DE&I standards.
- Increase overall efficiency in recruiting and workforce planning.

---

### 4. Background

- **Time Consuming**: Creating JDs from scratch takes considerable effort.
- **Inconsistent Materials**: Different teams produce varied JD styles and content.
- **Outdated Content**: Existing JDs often do not reflect current job market expectations.
- **DE&I Concerns**: JDs may inadvertently exclude certain groups or lack inclusive language.
- **Cultural Alignment**: JDs don’t always communicate the company’s values or work culture.
- **Dull Presentation**: Many JDs fail to stand out and attract top talent.

---

### 5. Hypothesis

If AI is used to combine multiple data sources (company data, third-party benchmarks, people & culture inputs) into a first draft, and then a refining bot polishes it to match the company’s tone of voice, **then** the organisation will produce high-quality, relevant, and inclusive job descriptions that attract better-suited candidates.

---

### 6. Proposed Action Plan

**What Will You Do?**  
Build a bot (Jobi) that drafts and refines JDs to ensure up-to-date, inclusive, and on-brand communication for potential candidates.

**How Will You Do It?**

1. **Confirm Business Vision**

   - Align on finance, DE&I, and cultural objectives for the JD creation process.

2. **Collaborate with People & Culture Team**

   - Understand key challenges in recruitment and current JD shortcomings.

3. **Identify Data Sources**

   - Gather internal data (role responsibilities, company culture info, salary benchmarks).
   - Incorporate external market data (industry standards, competitor benchmarks).

4. **Use AI for First Draft**

   - Generate an initial JD by merging relevant data into prompts.

5. **Editing & Refinement**
   - Implement a second-stage AI “editing bot” to polish language, tone, and style according to company voice guidelines.

---

### 7. Required Resources

- **Company Data** (current roles, cultural statements, existing JDs)
- **Third-Party Data** (market salary ranges, competitor analysis, DE&I best practices)
- **AI Knowledge** (prompt engineering, large language models)
- **People & Culture Team Input** (for feedback loops and acceptance)
- **Time Investment** (for tool development, training, and testing)

---

### 8. Measurement & KPIs

- **Time Saving**: Reduction in hours spent drafting JDs manually.
- **Candidate Quality**: Improved pool of applicants (e.g., higher shortlist-to-hire ratio, reduced time-to-fill).
- **JD Consistency**: Fewer variations in style, improved alignment with culture/DE&I.
- **DE&I Metrics**: Potential increase in diversity indicators among applicants if inclusive language is effectively used.

---

### 9. Challenges & Risks

- **Team Buy-In**: Some might view automation as a threat to their roles.
- **Metrics Selection**: Focusing on the wrong success indicators might skew the outcome (e.g., only speed vs. quality).
- **Bias**: Risk of “SINE Bias” if AI training inadvertently reinforces existing hiring stereotypes.
- **Technical Complexity**: Integrating diverse data sources and adjusting prompts can be complex.

---

### 10. Expected Learnings

- **Correlation Between JD Quality & Candidate Quality**: Confirm if well-crafted JDs attract more suitable applicants.
- **DE&I Impact**: Gauge whether inclusive language broadens candidate diversity.
- **Time & Cost Efficiency**: Determine if the new process truly decreases manual effort.
- **Future-Proofing**: Assess whether AI-driven JDs resonate with emerging market needs.
- **Visibility & Differentiation**: Evaluate if the improved JD format helps the company stand out to top talent.

---

### 11. Next Steps & Recommendations

- **Meeting with People & Culture**: Gather deeper insights and formalize acceptance criteria (e.g., style guidelines, DE&I objectives).
- **Pilot**: Implement a small-scale test for 1–2 roles to measure accuracy, inclusivity, and candidate response.
- **Feedback Loop**: Refine AI prompts and editing bot based on initial pilot results.
- **Broader Rollout**: If successful, apply Jobi to more roles or departments.

## Part 2: Business Value & ROI + Execution Plan

### Time-Savings Calculation & ROI (in GBP)

1. **Time Spent on JDs Currently**

   - Suppose a People & Culture team member spends ~4 hours crafting or updating each JD.
   - If the average cost (including overhead) is ~£30/hour, that’s ~£120 per JD.

2. **Annual JD Creation**

   - If the company posts ~40 unique roles or updates JDs annually, manual JD work costs ~£4,800/year.

3. **Potential Automation Savings**

   - If Jobi reduces manual drafting time by 50%, each JD might take only 2 hours to finalize, saving ~£60 per JD.
   - For 40 JDs: ~£2,400 total savings annually.

4. **Tool & Maintenance Costs**
   - AI platform (e.g., ChatGPT, custom LLM hosting): ~£600–£1,200/year depending on usage.
   - Net savings could be ~£1,200–£1,800/year after subscription costs, representing a decent ROI given intangible benefits (DE&I improvements, quality of hires, etc.).

_(Adjust these numbers for your actual volume and hourly rates.)_

---

### Extended Benefits

- **Consistency & Branding**: Uniform tone and style across all job postings.
- **Enhanced Diversity & Inclusion**: AI can prompt for inclusive language to attract a broader, more diverse talent pool.
- **Candidate Experience**: Clear, up-to-date, and engaging JDs can encourage stronger applicants.
- **Scalability**: The same approach could be adapted for creating internship postings, contractor roles, or strategic roles requiring special language.

---

### Phased Execution Plan

1. **Planning & Set-Up**

   - Define DE&I and cultural goals for JDs (e.g., inclusive language guidelines).
   - Consolidate relevant data (existing JDs, competitor analyses, industry benchmarks).

2. **Pilot Implementation**

   - Implement Jobi for a small subset of roles (e.g., 2–3 test positions).
   - Collaborate with People & Culture to refine prompts and measure candidate response.

3. **Monitoring & Optimisation**

   - Track how many JDs are completed, how long they take, and the quality of applicant pools.
   - Adjust AI prompts, tone-of-voice rules, and any DE&I criteria.

4. **Scaling & Roll-Out**
   - Expand Jobi to handle most/all JD creations.
   - Provide guidelines or training for hiring managers to request AI-crafted JDs.
   - Periodically review performance to ensure continuing alignment with market trends and DE&I best practices.

---

### Intangible Benefits

- **Elevated Employer Brand**: Refined, on-message JDs reflect well on the company’s identity and mission.
- **Increased Hiring Manager Satisfaction**: Less friction in the JD creation process.
- **Future-Ready Recruitment**: AI-driven job ads can respond quickly to changes in skill demands or industry shifts.
