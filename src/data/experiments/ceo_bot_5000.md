## Part 1: AI Experiment Report

### 1. Report Title

CEO BOT 5000 – Create a Bot that can reply to emails in the correct tone and style of the CEO (James)

### 2. Summary / Executive Overview

This experiment aims to automate the drafting of CEO email replies, currently done by the Executive Assistant (EA). By training a GPT model on James’s sent email history, we can produce responses that closely match his tone, style, and formality level, saving time for both James and his EA while maintaining consistent, on-brand communication.

### 3. Objective

Accelerate and simplify the process of drafting, reviewing, and sending emails on behalf of the CEO by generating replies that reflect his authentic voice for internal, sales, and client interactions.

### 4. Background

- The EA, Kate, currently prepares email drafts for James.
- James reviews and approves each email, which can be time-consuming.
- An AI-powered solution could cut down the back-and-forth without compromising on brand voice or professionalism.

### 5. Hypothesis

- **If** we create a style and tone-of-voice bot based on James’s email history, **then** we will significantly reduce the time spent on drafting and review.
- **If** we use ChatGPT to generate replies, **then** it will produce more accurate, context-aware responses than Gmail’s native “Gemini” feature.

### 6. Proposed Action Plan

**What Will You Do?**

- Build a GPT model that replicates James’s tone and style across different email types (internal, sales, client, etc.) by segmenting his existing sent emails.

**How Will You Do It?**

1. **Download Sent Emails**

   - Use Google Takeout to export James’s sent folder.
   - Separate or tag emails by category (e.g., internal staff emails, sales inquiries, client communications).

2. **Create Knowledge Docs**

   - Segment the data into distinct “style” or “tone” datasets.
   - Train or fine-tune a GPT model with these context-specific examples.

3. **Set Clear Instructions**

   - Outline the prompt structure, specifying the correct style based on email type (internal vs. sales vs. client).

4. **Refine Using Tools**
   - Leverage ChatGPT, NotebookLM, or other AI solutions to build a robust prototype.

### 7. Required Resources

- **Google Takeout** for data export.
- **ChatGPT** subscription or API access for training/testing.
- **NotebookLM** (optional) for knowledge management and reference.
- Time and technical expertise to clean, segment, and label email data.

### 8. Measurement & KPIs

- **Tone & Style Accuracy**: Subjective reviews by James and EA to confirm the bot’s outputs match the desired voice.
- **Time Saved**: Reduction in hours the EA and James spend drafting/reviewing emails.
- **Credibility**: External feedback (particularly from clients) on whether emails remain polished and professional.

### 9. Challenges & Risks

- **Data Separation**: Ensuring replies are isolated from incoming messages in email chains for correct context.
- **Integration**: ChatGPT might not integrate seamlessly with Gmail (compared to Gemini’s native approach).
- **Privacy/Security**: Handling sensitive email data responsibly.
- **Model Accuracy**: The AI may produce generic or incorrect tone if not properly trained.

### 10. Expected Learnings

- Deeper insight into James’s consistent writing patterns across various contexts.
- Understanding how an AI model interprets and replicates personal tone and style.
- Possible opportunities to streamline email communications at higher volume or across multiple executives.

### 11. Next Steps & Recommendations

- **Pilot with a Small Dataset**: Test on a limited set of James’s email history (e.g., 50–100 emails) to validate tone accuracy.
- **Feedback Loop**: Gather feedback from James and the EA; refine labeling or instructions.
- **Security Measures**: Ensure proper handling of private email content.
- **Potential Roll-Out**: If successful, consider using the same approach for other high-level team members.

## Part 2: Business Value & ROI + Execution Plan

### Time-Savings Calculation & ROI (in GBP)

- **Current Process**:

  - The EA may spend ~5 hours/week drafting replies for James.
  - James may spend ~2 hours/week refining or approving them.
  - Combined, ~7 hours/week are devoted to email drafting/review.

- **Hourly Rate Assumptions** (illustrative):

  - EA’s effective cost: ~£25/hour (including overhead).
  - James’s effective cost: ~£60/hour (as an executive).

- **Weekly Cost of Drafting/Review**:

  - EA: 5 hours × £25 = £125/week
  - James: 2 hours × £60 = £120/week
  - Total: ~£245/week

- **Possible Reduction**:

  - If the CEO Bot halves drafting and review time, they might save ~3.5 hours/week total (worth ~£122/week).
  - Annually, that’s ~£6,344 in direct labour savings (52 weeks × £122).

- **Tool Subscription**:

  - ChatGPT or comparable API: ~£20–£60/month depending on usage.
  - Annually, that’s up to ~£720 for the higher tier.

- **ROI Projection**:
  - Net Savings: ~£6,344 − ~£720 = ~£5,624/year.
  - Approx ROI = ~7.8:1 (i.e., ~£7.80 return for every £1 spent on the tool).

### Extended Benefits

- **Consistency & Branding**: Every email remains polished and “on voice,” reinforcing the CEO’s brand.
- **Scalable**: If other executives adopt similar bots, the savings multiply.
- **Better Efficiency**: Freed-up EA time can be reallocated to higher-value tasks (e.g., scheduling, stakeholder engagement).
- **Potential for Automation**: Could integrate further with CRM or Slack to unify communication workflows.

### Phased Execution Plan

1. **Planning & Set-Up**

   - Approve budget.
   - Clarify data privacy and security protocols for email exports.

2. **Pilot Implementation**

   - Export a small subset of James’s emails (e.g., last 3–6 months) via Google Takeout.
   - Train an initial GPT model focusing on 2–3 email categories (internal, sales, client).

3. **Monitoring & Optimisation**

   - Gather feedback from James and the EA.
   - Adjust labeling or style definitions for better accuracy.
   - Track time saved.

4. **Scaling & Roll-Out**
   - Expand to a larger email dataset if pilot is successful.
   - Automate/streamline the email drafting pipeline.
   - Evaluate possibility of other team members adopting the same approach.

### Intangible Benefits

- **Enhanced Professional Image**: Quick, consistent replies reflect responsiveness and leadership.
- **Employee Satisfaction**: Reduced repetitive drafting tasks can improve EA morale.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Archiving James’s best practices in tone/style can inform future brand guidelines.
