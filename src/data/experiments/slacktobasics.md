## Part 1: AI Experiment Report

### 1. Report Title

Slack to Basics: Cutting Out the Noise, Keeping What Matters

---

### 2. Summary / Executive Overview

This experiment aims to deploy an AI-powered Slack summarisation tool that consolidates messages from multiple Slack channels into concise, relevant updates. By reducing the time spent browsing irrelevant content and ensuring crucial updates are surfaced quickly, the initiative seeks to improve responsiveness and lower the risk of missing vital information.

---

### 3. Objective

- Reduce time spent reading Slack messages by at least 50%.
- Improve response times for critical updates from 24–48 hours to under 12 hours.
- Decrease missed key updates by at least 30%.

---

### 4. Background

SINE Digital manages 116 Slack channels, causing delays of 24–48 hours before essential updates are seen. Important information may be buried in irrelevant chatter, leading to missed deadlines or slow responses. An AI summarisation solution would streamline how employees interact with Slack, potentially boosting productivity.

---

### 5. Hypothesis

If we implement an AI-powered Slack summarisation tool that extracts key updates and provides daily or real-time summaries, then we will:

1. Reduce the time spent reading Slack messages by at least 50%.
2. Improve response times for critical updates from 24–48 hours to under 12 hours.
3. Decrease missed key updates by at least 30%, based on fewer follow-ups needed due to overlooked info.

---

### 6. Proposed Action Plan

**What Will You Do?**  
Provide hourly (or daily) summaries of key Slack messages relevant to specific roles, avoiding information overload.

**How Will You Do It?**

1. **Choose a Tool**

   - Evaluate Slack GPT, TL;DR Bot, Zapier + OpenAI API, etc.

2. **Set Up Summaries**

   - Install the chosen solution, monitor relevant channels, and extract key points/@mentions.

3. **Customise for Roles**

   - Create role-specific summaries (e.g., project managers see client feedback, developers see bug reports).

4. **Test & Refine**
   - Run a 2-week pilot with a small team, gather feedback, and adjust settings.

## Part 2: Business Value & ROI + Execution Plan

### Time-Savings Calculation & ROI (in GBP)

1. **Current State**

   - Average employee spends ~5 hours/week reading Slack messages.
   - With AI summarisation, this could drop to ~2.5 hours/week.
   - Time saved: ~2.5 hours/week per employee.

2. **Financial Impact**

   - Assume a fully loaded cost of ~£40/hour.
   - Saving 2.5 hours/week = £100/week.
   - Annually ~ £5,200 (over 52 weeks).

3. **Tool Costs**

   - Could range from ~£15 to £80/month, depending on usage tiers.
   - Yearly cost ~ £180 to £960.

4. **Net ROI**
   - Annual time-saving: ~£5,200.
   - Annual tool cost (high estimate): ~£960.
   - Net: ~£4,240 saved for a single user. That's an approximate 4.4:1 ROI.

### Extended Benefits

- **Scalability**: Additional team members could adopt the same solution, multiplying the savings.

- **Faster Response Times**: Quicker decision-making can positively impact project outcomes and client satisfaction.

- **Slack Streamlining**: Over time, could reduce the number of channels or clarify usage guidelines, further boosting productivity.

- **Employee Satisfaction**: Minimising "Slack overload" helps maintain staff engagement and may reduce turnover.

---

### Execution Plan

1. **Planning & Set-Up**

   - Select a tool based on features, cost, and ease of implementation.
   - Identify key channels and message types to prioritise.

2. **Pilot Implementation**

   - Start with a small team (3-5 people) for 2 weeks.
   - Gather feedback on summary quality, frequency, and format.

3. **Refinement & Expansion**

   - Adjust settings based on pilot feedback.
   - Roll out to additional teams in phases.

4. **Monitoring & Optimisation**
   - Track time savings and response improvements.
   - Regularly review and update channel priorities as projects evolve.
