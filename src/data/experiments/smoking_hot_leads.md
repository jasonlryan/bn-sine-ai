## Part 1: AI Experiment Report

### 1. Report Title

Smoking Hot Leads – Improving Lead Prioritisation for New Business

---

### 2. Summary / Executive Overview

This experiment aims to enhance lead prioritisation for SINE Digital as it expands into sectors beyond theatre and entertainment. Historically, almost all new business has come from referrals, leaving a large untapped pipeline for new sectors. By developing a lead-scoring framework, the team can target higher-potential opportunities, improving both conversion rates and overall efficiency in new business development.

---

### 3. Objective

- Develop a structured lead-scoring system (for Brandrocket) to identify the most suitable new business prospects from a long list of potential clients in new verticals.
- Increase conversion rates by focusing on leads that offer the best alignment with SINE Digital’s capabilities and resources.

---

### 4. Background

- **Current State**: Nearly 100% of new business historically comes from referrals in theatre/entertainment.
- **Opportunity**: Expanding into new sectors requires a more strategic, data-driven approach to prioritising leads.
- **Challenge**: Large lists of potential brands but no clear system for scoring or ranking leads.

---

### 5. Hypothesis

If SINE Digital develops a lead scoring system for new industry pipelines, then the conversion rate of net new business leads will improve, as higher-priority leads receive more targeted outreach and resources.

---

### 6. Proposed Action Plan

**What Will You Do?**  
Create a lead-scoring framework that evaluates each prospect on criteria such as “ease,” “impact,” and “urgency,” then rank them from 1–5 to guide outreach efforts.

**How Will You Do It?**

1. **Outline Framework**

   - Define criteria for lead prioritisation (e.g., market alignment, potential deal size, brand fit, urgency).
   - Assign a points-based system or weighting to each criterion.

2. **Gather Data Sources**

   - Compile a list of potential leads (beyond theatre).
   - Collect relevant data (e.g., revenue, marketing spend, brand synergy).

3. **Implement Scoring & Categorisation**

   - Score each prospect from 1–5 for each criterion.
   - Assign a total score that determines lead priority.

4. **Apply Treatment Framework**
   - Define how leads are approached based on score brackets (e.g., 4–5 = immediate outreach, 2–3 = nurture, 1 = low priority).

---

### 7. Required Resources

- **Lead Gen Agency**: External partner or resource to help gather and qualify lead data.
- **Internal Resource**: Time from the SINE Digital business development or Brandrocket team to build out and refine the scoring framework.
- **Data & Historical Performance**: Past new business conversion metrics, industry benchmarks, lists of potential leads.

---

### 8. Measurement & KPIs

- **Conversion Rate of New Leads**: Compare results over a 6-month period to baseline referral conversions.
- **Adoption & Usage**: Track how consistently the scoring framework is applied by the business development team.
- **Win/Loss Analysis**: Evaluate whether higher-scoring leads indeed have better outcomes.

---

### 9. Challenges & Risks

- **Model Accuracy**: Scoring criteria may need iterative refinement based on real-world feedback.
- **User Adoption**: Teams might revert to old habits if the framework isn’t easy or intuitive.
- **Data Quality**: Some lead details may be incomplete or outdated, affecting scoring precision.

---

### 10. Expected Learnings

- **Framework Effectiveness**: Determine whether structured scoring tangibly improves outreach efficiency and conversions.
- **Criteria Relevance**: Identify which factors most strongly correlate with successful deals.
- **Resource Allocation**: Discover if devoting more time to top-scoring leads actually yields a better ROI.

---

### 11. Next Steps & Recommendations

- **Pilot Phase**: Implement the scoring system for a limited set of potential leads (e.g., 20–30 prospects).
- **Feedback Loop**: Refine or adjust scoring criteria based on preliminary results.
- **Full Roll-Out**: Expand the approach across all new prospects in the pipeline.
- **Long-Term Tracking**: Regularly review conversion data to keep the model accurate and relevant.

## Part 2: Business Value & ROI + Execution Plan

### Time-Savings Calculation & ROI (in GBP)

1. **Current Approach**

   - Nearly all new business is referral-based, meaning time spent on cold leads is minimal but also lacks a systematic pipeline for expansions.
   - Without a structured approach, effort might be wasted on uninterested or low-value leads.

2. **Potential Gains with a Scoring Framework**

   - **Efficiency**: If the business development team currently spends ~10 hours/week hunting new leads, a targeted scoring approach may cut wasted hours by ~50%, saving ~5 hours/week.
   - Assuming a ~£35/hour blended cost, that’s ~£175/week, or ~£9,100/year in labor savings.

3. **Subscription / Development Costs**

   - Building the framework might be minimal in direct costs if using existing tools like Excel or basic CRM features.
   - If using a lead gen agency or advanced CRM subscription, costs could range from ~£1,000–£3,000/year.

4. **Net ROI**
   - If improved targeting leads to even one additional new client, that could substantially boost revenue.
   - The intangible benefits of time saved and better client fit can also raise morale and reduce churn.

### Extended Benefits

- **Improved Conversion Rates**: Focusing on the best leads should increase overall success in new markets.
- **Scalable Model**: Once proven, this approach can apply to other industries or verticals.
- **Better Brand Reputation**: Outreach becomes more relevant and personalised, potentially leaving a better impression on prospective clients.

### Phased Execution Plan

1. **Planning & Set-Up**

   - Define scoring criteria (e.g., company size, brand synergy, urgency, potential budget).
   - Gather existing lead lists and relevant data.

2. **Pilot Implementation**

   - Score a set of leads (e.g., 20–30) to test the framework.
   - Evaluate which leads get top scores and compare them with historically successful referrals.

3. **Monitoring & Optimisation**

   - Track conversions, cost per lead, and average deal size.
   - Refine scores if certain high-scoring leads don’t convert, or if low-scoring leads unexpectedly pan out.

4. **Scaling & Roll-Out**
   - Incorporate the lead scoring system into day-to-day business development processes.
   - Train more team members or add automation (e.g., CRM integration) for large-scale lead lists.

### Intangible Benefits

- **Better Team Focus**: Concentrating on top leads prevents scattergun outreach and fosters a more proactive, strategic mindset.
- **Improved Data Culture**: Using a structured approach can encourage data-driven decision-making in other areas of the business.
