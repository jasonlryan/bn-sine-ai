## Part 1: AI Experiment Report

### 1. Report Title

“SINE Says” – A Personalised AI Critique Bot

---

### 2. Summary / Executive Overview

This experiment aims to create a personalised AI feedback tool, “SINE Says,” that delivers role-specific critiques to users (e.g., a project manager and a strategist). By integrating structured data—job descriptions, example work samples, and competency matrices—the bot can provide more actionable, context-aware feedback. Initially, the goal is to improve task execution and efficiency for these two roles before considering a broader rollout.

---

### 3. Objective

- Build and pilot a personalised AI critique system that offers targeted feedback to improve workflow, communication, and decision-making.
- Validate whether immediate AI-driven advice can reduce bottlenecks, refine task quality, and speed up project completion.

---

### 4. Background

- **Challenges**: Agency teams often struggle with task delegation, quality control, and timely feedback loops.
- **Rationale**: A role-aware AI tool can offer immediate, constructive input to specific job functions, cutting down on back-and-forth revisions.
- **Pilot**: Starting with two individuals (a project manager and a strategist) will help refine the MVP and confirm the tool’s value before scaling.

---

### 5. Hypothesis

If SINE Says uses relevant contextual inputs (job descriptions, competency matrix, work samples) to generate customized critiques, then users will find the feedback more precise, actionable, and time-saving—leading to improved overall efficiency and faster task execution.

---

### 6. Proposed Action Plan

**What Will You Do?**  
Develop and test a personalized AI critique bot for two pilot roles—project manager and strategist—to ensure role-specific, structured feedback.

**How Will You Do It?**

1. **Week 1**

   - Define feedback criteria (identify areas for improvement, success metrics, etc.).
   - Collect example work and job descriptions to feed into the AI model.
   - Build a prototype bot using structured prompts aligned with a coaching or competency framework.

2. **Week 2**
   - Deploy the prototype to users (project manager & strategist).
   - Gather user feedback via quick surveys or interviews.
   - Refine and finalize the MVP, adjusting prompts or data sources as needed.

---

### 7. Required Resources

- **Job Descriptions**: To understand role expectations.
- **Work Samples**: Example deliverables or documents for personalization.
- **Competency Matrix**: Framework to align feedback with desired skill levels and behaviors.
- **Coaching Framework**: e.g., GROW or a similar model for structured, meaningful feedback.
- **Development Time**: At least two weeks for prototyping, testing, and iteration.

---

### 8. Measurement & KPIs

- **Usage**: Frequency and consistency of bot interactions (are users regularly seeking AI feedback?).
- **Effectiveness**: Survey or user feedback on how useful the critiques are.
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduction in revision cycles or faster task completion times (as reported by the pilot participants).

---

### 9. Challenges & Risks

- **Accuracy & Relevance**: AI critiques may need ongoing fine-tuning to be truly helpful.
- **User Adoption**: If initial feedback is generic or unhelpful, users may resist using the tool.
- **Scalability**: The prototype focuses on two roles; broader expansion could require additional customization.

---

### 10. Expected Learnings

- **AI Critique Effectiveness**: How well AI-driven feedback resonates with different roles.
- **Feedback Preferences**: Identifying the most impactful types of feedback (task prioritization, communication style, etc.).
- **Personalization**: Understanding if tailored GPT inputs meaningfully outperform general-purpose AI prompts.
- **User Engagement**: Gauging whether team members find ongoing value in daily or weekly AI critiques.

---

### 11. Next Steps & Recommendations

- **Prototype**: Build a basic version with one critique type per role.
- **Pilot Testing**: Roll out to the project manager and strategist, track usage and gather feedback.
- **Refinement**: Adjust the model based on user insights (e.g., deeper personalization, improved context).
- **Potential Expansion**: Once proven effective, adapt the system to other roles, possibly requiring unique data sets or feedback structures.

## Part 2: Business Value & ROI + Execution Plan

### Time-Savings Calculation & ROI (in GBP)

1. **Current Feedback Cycle**

   - Suppose each role spends ~2 hours/week collecting or clarifying feedback.
   - At a ~£40/hour loaded cost, that’s £80/week per person.
   - Over 2 roles, ~£160/week, or ~£8,320/year (assuming 52 weeks).

2. **AI-Assisted Approach**

   - If the personalised AI critique bot cuts feedback loops by half, the weekly cost per role drops to ~£40, saving ~£80/week across 2 roles (~£4,160/year).
   - Subtract potential tool costs or subscription fees, say ~£600/year, leaving a net saving of ~£3,560.

3. **Additional Gains**
   - Improved decision-making and fewer revisions can reduce project delays, improving client satisfaction (though this is harder to quantify directly).

### Extended Benefits

- **Faster Iteration**: Immediate AI feedback reduces waiting times for manager or peer reviews.
- **Higher Quality Output**: More consistent application of best practices could yield better final deliverables.
- **Scalable for Other Roles**: Once proven, the approach can be adapted for designers, developers, or account managers.

### Phased Execution Plan

1. **Planning & Set-Up**

   - Confirm role-specific feedback metrics and gather relevant documents.
   - Select or develop a coaching/competency framework.
   - Outline integration requirements (e.g., Slack or web app interface).

2. **Pilot Implementation**

   - Develop the prototype bot with one or two key feedback prompts.
   - Roll out to the project manager & strategist for a two-week trial.

3. **Monitoring & Optimisation**

   - Collect feedback on how frequently they use SINE Says and whether the suggestions are actionable.
   - Adjust prompts, add deeper role context, or refine the AI model to address weaknesses.

4. **Scaling & Roll-Out**
   - If pilot is successful, extend the AI critique to other roles or teams.
   - Introduce advanced features like progressive feedback levels, integration with PM software, or direct Slack notifications.

### Intangible Benefits

- **Enhanced Professional Development**: Encouraging a culture of continuous learning and self-improvement.
- **Better Team Dynamics**: Objective, AI-driven feedback can mitigate personal bias.
- **Positive Brand Image**: Showcasing internal innovation can attract talent and impress clients.
