## Part 1: AI Experiment Report

### 1. Report Title

Sine Persona Platform – Building Bespoke Personas for Campaign Planning

---

### 2. Summary / Executive Overview

This experiment aims to develop and refine a platform for creating in-depth, AI-driven personas that align with Sine Digital’s typical target audiences. By moving beyond basic demographics and lookalike targeting, these bespoke personas will guide campaign planning, media mix decisions, creative messaging, and channel activation. The end goal is to better understand our audiences, increase campaign performance, and communicate audience insights more effectively to clients.

---

### 3. Objective

- Create AI-generated personas that reflect genuine consumer interests and behaviors.
- Use these personas to inform campaign strategies, from creative development to media activation and performance measurement.

---

### 4. Background

- **Current Limitations**: The team predominantly relies on “Lookalike” audiences with limited granularity.
- **Need for Depth**: Clients require a richer understanding of audience motivations, interests, and digital behaviors rather than basic demographics.
- **Opportunity**: An AI-driven approach can unify multiple data sources, refining personas iteratively and tying them to measurable outcomes.

---

### 5. Hypothesis

If we use AI to create nuanced consumer personas tailored to each client’s unique goals, then we can build more resonant campaigns, better identify the right audiences, and deliver higher engagement or performance metrics (e.g., higher video completion rates, stronger click-through rates, etc.).

### 6. Proposed Action Plan

**What Will You Do?**  
Develop one bespoke “Sine Persona” prototype as a pilot, using aggregated data from multiple sources to illustrate how deeper audience segmentation can enhance campaign planning and targeting.

**How Will You Do It?**

1. **Explore Current Clients & Popular Audiences**

   - Identify common segments or interest areas using existing platform insights.
   - Gather data from GWI, Pulsar, BuzzSumo, Google Ads, Gener8, Perplexity, Ozone, and internal data warehouses.

2. **Create a Persona-Building Bot**

   - Combine the above data sources to generate a refined, data-driven persona.
   - Assign unique traits, interests, typical channels, and pain points.

3. **Integration & Strategy**

   - Link persona insights to channel planning, media mix, and creative messaging.
   - Align persona traits with campaign KPIs for continuous measurement.

4. **Test & Iterate**
   - Launch campaigns using these persona insights.
   - Collect performance data (e.g., VTR for video campaigns, CTR or conversions).
   - Refine persona definitions or expand to more personas based on initial results.

---

### 7. Required Resources

- **Data Partners**: GWI, Pulsar, BuzzSumo, Google Ads, Gener8, Perplexity, Ozone.
- **Internal Data**: SINE’s data warehouse metrics and performance logs.
- **Team Collaboration**: Involvement from planning, creative, and analytics teams.
- **Time & Tech**: Resources to set up the persona-building bot and relevant integrations.

---

### 8. Measurement & KPIs

- **Persona Use**: Frequency of persona reference in campaign briefs and strategy documents.
- **Campaign Performance**: For instance, Video Through Rate (VTR) if it’s a video campaign, or conversions if it’s a direct-response campaign.
- **Audience Relevance**: Qualitative feedback on how well the personas match real-world audiences.
- **Ongoing Persona Evolution**: Degree to which personas adapt over time, incorporating new data.

---

### 9. Challenges & Risks

- **Measuring Persona Effectiveness**: Tracking how directly persona-based planning influences campaign outcomes.
- **Quality of Research**: Reliance on accurate, up-to-date data sources.
- **Integration Complexity**: Merging data from multiple providers may require advanced ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- **Usability**: Ensuring the final persona profiles are actionable, interesting, and easy for teams to incorporate into daily workflow.

---

### 10. Expected Learnings

- **ROI of Persona-Led Marketing**: Confirm whether deeper audience segmentation correlates with improved campaign metrics.
- **Data Utilisation**: Determine how effectively AI can merge multiple data streams into coherent audience segments.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Identify best practices for evolving personas as market trends shift and new data emerges.
- **Cross-Team Adoption**: Understand how different departments (creative, media, analytics) collaborate using persona insights.

---

### 11. Next Steps & Recommendations

- **Build One Persona Prototype**: Start small, focusing on a single persona that addresses a common or high-value audience.
- **Launch a Test Campaign**: Apply this persona to a live campaign and track performance.
- **Refine & Scale**: If successful, create additional personas for other audiences or client segments.
- **Integrate with Reporting**: Feed performance data back to refine persona assumptions (continuous improvement).

## Part 2: Business Value & ROI + Execution Plan

### Time-Savings Calculation & ROI (in GBP)

1. **Current Approach**

   - Teams often rely on limited demographic data or broad “lookalike” targeting.
   - Generating a persona might currently take multiple hours of scattered research, leading to suboptimal or generic audience insights.

2. **AI-Driven Persona Development**

   - If creating a persona manually takes ~8 hours at ~£35/hour = ~£280 per persona.
   - An AI-powered approach that consolidates data could cut that by half, saving ~£140 per persona.
   - If ~10 personas are developed across multiple clients, annual savings could be ~£1,400, not counting the improvement in campaign results.

3. **Subscription & Data Integration Costs**
   - Third-party data sources and AI platform subscriptions might total ~£500–£1,000/year.
   - Net savings are still possible, especially factoring in better performance outcomes (e.g., more effective campaigns).

### Extended Benefits

- **Improved Client Satisfaction**: Demonstrating robust, data-backed audience insights differentiates SINE from competitors.
- **Higher Campaign ROI**: Targeting more relevant audiences can increase conversions, awareness, or engagement.
- **Cross-Functional Alignment**: Teams use a consistent audience language, from creatives to media buyers.

### Phased Execution Plan

1. **Planning & Set-Up**

   - Identify key data sources.
   - Obtain necessary API access and data-sharing agreements (e.g., GWI, Pulsar).
   - Outline persona-building methodology (structure, naming conventions, key attributes).

2. **Pilot Implementation**

   - Build a single persona from aggregated data for a specific campaign or client.
   - Use the AI persona to inform channel mix and creative direction.

3. **Monitoring & Optimisation**

   - Track campaign metrics (e.g., VTR, CTR) to assess whether persona targeting outperforms default lookalike settings.
   - Gather feedback from internal stakeholders on the clarity and usability of persona insights.

4. **Scaling & Roll-Out**
   - Develop additional personas if the pilot proves successful.
   - Incorporate persona references into standard campaign briefs and media plans.
   - Regularly update personas as new data becomes available.

### Intangible Benefits

- **Deeper Audience Understanding**: Insights into motivations, barriers, and content preferences beyond age or gender.
- **Future-Proof Marketing**: An evolving persona library that adapts to changing trends or new platforms.
- **Strong Client Relationships**: Presenting thorough audience intelligence can build trust and position SINE as a strategic partner.
